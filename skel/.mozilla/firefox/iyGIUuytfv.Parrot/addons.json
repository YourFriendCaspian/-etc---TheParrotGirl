WOT adds intuitive traffic light-style icons next to search results and URLs so you can decide whether to visit a site:\n•Green – The site is trusted\n•Yellow – Be cautious\n•Red – Online threats detected","fullDescription":"WOT OVERVIEW\nWeb of Trust (aka WOT) is a known worldwide website reputation and rating service that helps you make informed decisions about whether to trust a website or not when you are searching, shopping or surfing online. WOT increases your personal online security and web safety. Web Of Trust is based on the Crowdsourcing Approach. Millions of users rate websites throughout the Internet and share their personal experience. This helps you avoid online threats that only real life experience can detect, such as scams, untrustworthy links, rogue web stores, etc.\n\nHOW WEB OF TRUST WORKS\nThe WOT add-on shows website reputations as traffic lights next to search results when you use Google, Yahoo!, Bing or any other search engine: green for good, red for bad, and yellow as a warning to be cautious. These icons are also visible next to links in social networking websites like Facebook and Twitter; Email services like Gmail and Yahoo!Mail; as well as popular websites like Wikipedia.\nBy clicking the traffic light icon you can find details about a website’s reputation, safety information and users’ opinions. A green traffic light means users have rated the site as trusted and reliable, red warns about danger or potential online threats and yellow indicates that you need to be cautious when using a site.\n\nWEB OF TRUST ADVANTAGES\nWOT ratings and reviews are powered by a global community of millions of users who rate websites based on their personal experiences. In addition, trusted third-party sources are used to warn you about malicious software and other online threats that you might encounter.\nYou can share your experiences too by rating websites and help make the Internet a safer place for everyone.\nWeb Of Trust (WOT) has been featured in the New York Times, CNET, PC World, Kim Komando show, Tech Republic, PC Welt and many other popular media.\nInstall the WOT add-on for your Firefox browser!
