# Drives to register for packet writing:
# If there is more than one, separate with spaces: DEVICES="/dev/hdd /dev/sr0"
# Usually, the following should work:
#DEVICES="/dev/cdrw"

# Pktcdvd patches for kernels 2.6.8 and later use a new interface for
# talking to the kernel, as well as a new set of device nodes. In case
# detection of the proper interface on your system fails, override
# it here. Possible values are "true" or "false".
#NEWINT=true

# Only when using the new interface do you have the option to choose the
# names for the packet writing devices. This is ignored otherwise.
# For example, if DEVICES="/dev/hdd /dev/sr0" and
# NEWINTNAMES="cdwriter dvdwriter", then /dev/hdd will correspond to
# /dev/pktcdvd/cdwriter, and /dev/sr0 will correspond to
# /dev/pktcdvd/dvdwriter. The default setting is NEWINTNAMES="0 1 2 3".
#NEWINTNAMES="0 1 2 3"
